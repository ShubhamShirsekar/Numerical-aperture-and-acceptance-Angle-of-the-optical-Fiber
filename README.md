# Numerical-aperture-and-acceptance-Angle-of-the-optical-Fiber
This code helps determine the numerical aperture and acceptance angle of an optical fiber. 
It takes two inputs refractive index and cladding index to determine the numerical aperture and acceptance angle
There are two ways in which the numerical aperture is calculated to verify the value and double check it
Finally the acceptance angle of the optical fiber
